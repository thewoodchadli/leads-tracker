An amazing chrome extension that saves/tracks leads. 

This app was another exercise as part of learning javaScript on <a href="scrimba.com"> Scrimba </a>. This app majorly deals with DOM and uses the introductory concepts in javaScript. A fantastic learning experience and an even better reuslt in the form of a chrome extension.
